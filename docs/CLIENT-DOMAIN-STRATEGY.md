# Client Domain and Traffic Routing Architecture

## Current Setup (Your Demo/Proof-of-Concept):
```
[Users] → [agent.reisdematos.ch] → [Cloudflare] → [AKS LoadBalancer IP] → [Kong] → [AI Services]
```

## Production Client Setup (Recommended):
```
[Client Users] → [chat.client-company.com] → [Azure Front Door] → [Client's AKS] → [AI Services]
```

## Why Client-Owned Domains are Better:

### Option A: Client Uses Their Own Domain (Recommended)
```yaml
Client: LawFirm ABC
Domain: chat.lawfirm-abc.com
DNS: Points to Azure Front Door (abc123.azurefd.net)
SSL: Managed by Azure Front Door
Branding: Fully client-branded experience
```

### Option B: You Provide Subdomain (Demo/Starter)
```yaml
Domain: lawfirm-abc.reisdematos.ch  
DNS: You manage, points to client's Front Door
SSL: You manage via Cloudflare
Branding: Mixed (your domain, their content)
```

## Benefits of Client-Owned Domains:
✅ **Trust**: Users see familiar company domain
✅ **Branding**: No mention of your company
✅ **Security**: Client controls DNS/SSL
✅ **Compliance**: Some industries require it
✅ **Future-Proof**: Client can migrate if needed
