# kubeconfig.template
# This is a template file for your Kubernetes configuration
# 
# After deploying your AKS cluster with Terraform, run:
# az aks get-credentials --resource-group <your-rg> --name <your-cluster> --file ./kubeconfig
#
# Or copy your existing kubeconfig content here and rename to 'kubeconfig'
#
# IMPORTANT: Never commit the actual kubeconfig file - it contains sensitive cluster credentials
